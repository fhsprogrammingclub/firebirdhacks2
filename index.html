            <h2>What is Firebird Hacks</h2>
            <p>FrontierHacks is a (24) hour hackathon partnered with SMYLE, a nonprofit organization for student
                volunteers, focusing on providing a center of innovation for students all over the Bay Area to empower
                student communities around the world. FrontierHacks is also a friendly and welcoming environment where
                teams of new and experienced coders are able to build a project, learn new skills, and have a great
                time!</p>

        <div class="faqcomponent" id="team">
            <h2>Can I work in a team?</h2>
            <p>Competitors are allowed to work individually or in teams of up to 4 people.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faqcomponent" id="cost">
            <h2>What do I need to pay for?</h2>
            <p>FirebirdHacks is completely free of charge! All food, drinks, and swag are included as we want to create
                the best possible environment for hackers.</p>

        <div class="faqcomponent" id="hackathon">
            <h2>What is a hackathon?</h2>
            <p>A Hackathon is a 24 to 36 hour long coding marathon event where people can make the most bizarre ideas
                into reality. Over the course of the weekend, students collaborate to create projects, listen to
                exquisite workshop presentations, exercise their programming abilities, and of course, have tons of
                fun!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faqcomponent" id="prerequisites">
            <h2>Are there any required prerequisites?</h2>
            <p>You are only allowed to work on your projects at FrontierHacks and any forms of precoding is forbidden.
                Stealing source code and claiming it as your own is also highly forbidden. Furthermore, you also are
                subject to the MLH Code of Conduct, which you can read here.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faqcomponent" id="is-needed">
            <h2>What will I need to bring?</h2>
            <p>You will need a laptop, a valid student ID (or some sort of student ID), chargers, your phone, a
                blanket/sleeping bag, toiletries, and any supplies you need for your hack.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faqcomponent" id="experience">
            <h2>Do I need any programming experience?</h2>
            <p>Not at all! In fact, FrontierHacks is a great way to begin your programming experience! A basic
                understanding is recommended, but we will have workshops and mentors to help you make your project idea
                a reality. However, you must be a middle/high schooler over the age of 13.</p>
